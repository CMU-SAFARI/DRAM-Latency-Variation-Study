# DRAM Latency Variation Study

Latency characterization data collected on 30 real DRAM SO-DIMMs. You can find the background and analysis on the data in our SIGMETRICS'16 paper ["Understanding Latency Variation in Modern DRAM Chips: Experimental Characterization, Analysis, and Optimization"](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~kevincha/papers/chang_sigmetrics16.pdf).

All the data points collected from our experiments are in
`data_latvar_sigmetrics2016.csv`. The first column of the data is the index
that we use for parsing using [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/). The rest of
the columns contain headers that describe the data points.
